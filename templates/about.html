    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>
    The formation of the group grew out of a meeting 
    Gandalf had with Thorin in Bree which kindled 
    Thorin's interest in recapturing his long lost 
    family inheritance. (Thorin's grandfather had 
    been the king of the Lonely Mountain when Smaug 
    came and took it.) Remembering that he had once 
    known an adventurous Hobbit on his travels in 
    the Shire, Gandalf decided to add Bilbo to their
     company because he knew that stealth and cunning
      were preferable to force. Gandalf also believed
       that someone like Bilbo could keep the 
       sometimes prideful and stubborn Dwarves from 
       rash action. The superstitious Dwarves also 
       considered thirteen to be an unlucky number, 
       and as Gandalf had planned to leave on other 
       business, welcomed a fourteenth to fill into 
       their party.

            <h3>Thorin Oakenshield</h3>
            <p>
            In the year TA 2746, Thorin II was born to Dwarven
             prince Thráin II in the mountain city of The Lonely
              Mountain. Early in his youth, he and the other
               Dwarves of the Lonely Mountain were forced to 
               flee by the dragon Smaug in TA 2770. While in 
               exile, he quickly grew to become a capable warrior. 
               This was demonstrated when he participated in the 
               Battle of Azanulbizar in TA 2799. He marched with 
               one of the Dwarven armies beneath the East-gate of 
               Moria. At some point in the fighting, his shield 
               broke, and using an oaken tree branch found on the
                floor as a shield, he gained the epithet 
                "Oakenshield," which would remain with him 
                even in death.

            <h3>Fíli and Kíli</h3>
            <p>
            Fíli and Kíli were nephews of Thorin, who was 
            the elder brother of their mother Dís. They 
            were also nephews of Frerin, grandsons of 
            Thráin II, and great-grandsons of Thror. Fíli's 
            most distinguishing feature was his long nose, 
            the longest of any of the Dwarves on the Quest 
            of Erebor.

            <h3>Oin</h3>
            <p>
            Óin was the older brother of Glóin, cousin 
            of Dwalin and Balin, and uncle of Gimli. 
            He usually wore a brown-hooded cloak when 
            travelling. Óin fought in the Battle of 
            Azanulbizar along with Thorin Oakenshield, 
            and in TA 2941 joined with Thorin and Company 
            on the quest to reclaim the Lonely Mountain 
            wearing a brown hood.[2] Óin was one of the 
            Dwarves who bet that Bilbo would come along 
            with them to reclaim the Lonely Mountain. Óin 
            and his brother Glóin were usually in charge of 
            preparing the fire for the Company. He fought in 
            and survived the Battle of the Five Armies, and 
            later settled in the Lonely Mountain along with 
            many other dwarves of The Company of Thorin.

            <h3>Gloin</h3>
            <p>
            In TA 2799, Glóin was known to have fought in the 
            Battle of Azanulbizar, the last battle of the War 
            of the Dwarves and Orcs. In TA 2941, Glóin and his 
            brother Óin, along with his cousins Dwalin and Balin, 
            were among the Dwarves accompanying Thorin and 
            Company during their quest to the Lonely Mountain 
            to recapture The Kingdom of Erebor from the Dragon 
            Smaug. He was noted for his skills with a tinderbox, 
            and, along with his brother Óin, was usually the one 
            told to get a fire started whenever the Dwarves made 
            camp. Gloin also fought in the Battle of the Five 
            Armies.[1] After the battle, he settled back into 
            the Lonely Mountain.
